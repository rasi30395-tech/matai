### GOAL:
Generate a valid ManimCE Python script to animate the given math problem with class name as MyScene.

### INPUT:
{combined_input}

### REQUIREMENTS:
- padding = 2
-set fontsize 25 always
- black screen
- if the question has more than 15 words split it into several line so that it fits in frame properly
- no overlapping of objects in the animation
- Balance timing and pacing 
- Do NOT use `frame_height` or any automatic scaling tied to frame size.
- Use manual positioning with `.to_edge(DOWN|UP|LEFT|RIGHT, buff=...)` or `.next_to()` and `.move_to(...)` for clean structure.
- Layout should be:
  1. Top: Question text → Use `.to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)`
  2. Middle: All objects (shapes/graphics) → Use `.move_to(ORIGIN)` or `.next_to()` to align visuals.
  3. top: Final solution/summary text → Use `.to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)`all solution should be displayed at once
  4. Add labels to visuals using `.next_to(shape, direction)` (e.g., `label.next_to(sphere, DOWN)`).
- Fade in and fade out:
  - Fade in the question text from the top region, then fade out resize the text fit the frame accordingly.
  - Fade in the visuals from the Middle region, fade out.
  - Fade in the solution steps (math).

- Focus on visual strength with more objects.
- Label the objects properly (e.g., "car", "bridge").
- Do not include ShowCreation; instead, use Create function.
- Output: Only valid ManimCE code starting with `from manim import *`, using `class MyScene(Scene):`.
- refer this link while creating code 'https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html'
- refer this also 'https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim'


DO NOT include explanations, backticks, or markdown.
Ensure it can be run with `manim -pql generated_scene.py MyScene` without error.

### OBJECTIVES:
-set fontsize 25 always and split the question if it has more than 15 words
-if the question has more than 15 words split it into several line so that it fits in frame properly
- Replace crude SPGs with more realistic ones.
- Improve size, proportion, color, and spatial layout.
- Use manual positioning with `.to_edge(DOWN|UP|LEFT|RIGHT, buff=...)` or `.next_to()` and `.move_to(...)` for clean structure.

  - Fade in the question text from the top region, then fade out resize the text fit the frame accordingly.
  - Fade in the visuals from the Middle region, fade out.
  - Fade in the solution steps (math).
- text should correctly fit the frame 
- it should perfectly fit in the frame
- Add proper labels to objects.
- Maintain animation logic, just refine the visuals.
- refer this link while creating code 'https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html'
- refer this also 'https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim'
- text and objects should not overlap
-look at the fade in fade out the timing should be correct such that it oes not overlap

### OBJECTIVES:
-set fontsize 25 always
-if the question has more than 15 words split it into several line so that it fits in frame properly
- Add elegant transitions: FadeIn, Transform, Succession, Waits
- sometimes the text moves out of the frame or screen avoid that and also avoid overlapping of manim objects and text
- only use FadeIn and FadeOut do not use Fadefromcentre etc
- Use manual positioning with `.to_edge(DOWN|UP|LEFT|RIGHT, buff=...)` or `.next_to()` and `.move_to(...)` for clean structure.

You are a Manim code checker and auto-fixer. Your job is to analyze the provided Manim code and return a corrected version if there are any errors.

Fix all of the following types of issues:
- Syntax errors (e.g. unexpected indent, missing colons, misused parentheses)
- Runtime errors (e.g. UnboundLocalError, TypeError, missing arguments)
- Incorrect usage of Manim classes or methods (e.g. Dot, Rectangle, Axes, get_graph)
- Improper object initialization (e.g. passing duplicate keyword arguments)
- Issues related to missing files (e.g. images or SVGs not found)
- Logical mistakes such as missing animations or scene breaks

❗️Never return the same code again if an error exists. Always analyze the given error and correct the code logically.

❌ Do NOT return:
- Markdown formatting (no triple backticks)
- Headings like "Here's the fixed code:"
- Any explanation or extra commentary

✅ Only return:
The corrected, clean, runnable Python code (Manim CE compatible). Ensure it can be run with `manim -pql generated_scene.py MyScene` without error.
